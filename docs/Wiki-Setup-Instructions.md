# GitHub Wiki Setup Instructions

## How to Sync Local Documentation to GitHub Wiki

The GitHub Wiki for this repository needs to be manually populated with the documentation created in the `/docs` directory. Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Access the Wiki
1. Go to the repository: https://github.com/thejaustin/termux-ai-app
2. Click on the "Wiki" tab
3. Click "Create the first page" to initialize the wiki

## Step 2: Add Documentation Pages
Create the following pages in the wiki, transferring content from the local documentation files:

### Home Page
- Title: "Home"
- Content: Copy from `/docs/Home.md`

### UX/UI Improvements Page
- Title: "UX-UI-Improvements"
- Content: Copy from `/docs/UX-UI-Improvements.md`

### Mobile Gestures Guide Page
- Title: "Mobile-Gestures-Guide"
- Content: Copy from `/docs/Mobile-Gestures-Guide.md`

### Accessibility Features Page
- Title: "Accessibility-Features"
- Content: Copy from `/docs/Accessibility-Features.md`

### Claude Code Setup Page
- Title: "Claude-Code-Setup"
- Content: Copy from `/docs/Claude-Code-Setup.md`

### Architecture Overview Page
- Title: "Architecture-Overview"
- Content: Copy from `/docs/Architecture-Overview.md`

## Step 3: Format for Wiki
When transferring the content, make sure to:
- Keep the same markdown formatting
- Update any relative links to point to other wiki pages
- Add a navigation section at the top of each page

## Step 4: Verification
After creating the pages, verify that:
- All links work correctly
- Images and diagrams display properly
- The navigation is intuitive
- All content is accurately transferred

## Alternative Approach
If you prefer to keep documentation in the repository instead of the wiki:
- The files in the `/docs` directory serve the same purpose
- They're version-controlled with the code
- They can be accessed directly through the repository
- This is also a valid approach for project documentation

## Note
GitHub Wikis are separate from the main repository and need to be maintained independently. The documentation files created locally in the `/docs` directory contain all the necessary information about the UX/UI improvements made to the Termux AI app.
