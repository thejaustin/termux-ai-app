# GitHub Wiki Setup Notes

The documentation files created in the `/docs` directory should be transferred to the actual GitHub Wiki for proper wiki functionality. 

To set up the GitHub Wiki properly:
1. Go to https://github.com/thejaustin/termux-ai-app/wiki
2. Create the following pages:
   - Home (from Home.md)
   - UX-UI-Improvements (from UX-UI-Improvements.md)
   - Mobile-Gestures-Guide (from Mobile-Gestures-Guide.md)
   - Accessibility-Features (from Accessibility-Features.md)
   - Claude-Code-Setup (from Claude-Code-Setup.md)
   - Architecture-Overview (from Architecture-Overview.md)

Alternatively, you can continue to use the markdown files in the `/docs` directory as documentation within the repository itself, which is also a common practice.

The files in the `/docs` directory contain comprehensive documentation about all the UX/UI improvements made to the Termux AI app.
