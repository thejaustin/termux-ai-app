# Complete UI Polish and Optimization

- [ ] Enhance visual feedback for AI operations (loading states, progress indicators)
- [ ] Improve accessibility features (TalkBack support, content descriptions)
- [ ] Ensure consistent dark/light theme implementation
- [ ] Optimize UI rendering performance for terminal views
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for key interactions
