# Implement On-device AI Models

## Description
Implement local AI processing for privacy and offline capabilities. This would allow basic AI functions to work without internet connection.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research suitable on-device AI models
- [ ] Integrate TensorFlow Lite or similar for on-device inference
- [ ] Implement local command suggestion engine
- [ ] Add offline mode indicators
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for when online services are unavailable
- [ ] Optimize models for mobile performance
- [ ] Add settings to control on-device vs cloud processing
